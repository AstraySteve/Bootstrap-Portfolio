                                My name is Steven Tran, and I'm currently looking for a career in the direction of
                                a full-stack web developer. I have studied at the University of Toronto with a major
                                in computer-science and have used the following programming languages:
                                Python, Java, JavaScript, C, C# and C++. I am looking forward to reinforcing my 
                                knowledge and building a presentable portfolio at the UofT SCS Coding Bootcamp.
                            </P>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                Aside from working and playing around with computers and programming, my core skillset
                                and interest revolves around being able to create things. My hobbies involves making
                                replica props from various media and building scaled plastic or 'paper' (cardstock) models.
                                With this said, I have a future interest in a branching career path either into the gaming
                                or animation industries. 
                            </p>

                                Fun Fact: My other hobby is archery, and I can't wait for the weather to be good enough
                                to hit the range again.
